My dotfiles:

* do not git checkout in this directory without first saving changes
* this directory contains original files linked to from ~/. 
* keep hhenry/.vimrc smaller for remotes

Requirements when starting on a new machine:

```
mkdir -p ~/Personal
mkdir -p ~/Work
```

Set dotfiles in ~/Personal
